# Highlight Color Shortcut

Current default is:

* Red
* Orange
* Yellow
* Green
* Light Green (L)
* Blue
* Purple
* Brown (N)
* White
* Cyan (D)

Shortcut is Ctrl + Alt + (First letter)
(exceptions placed in brackets, e.g. Ctrl + Shift + N for brown)

Colour names can be standard colour names like "red", or red/green/blue colour codes like #ffffff.

Make sure the keyboard shortcut you have chosen does not overlap with other anki keyboard shortcuts, as those take
precedent!
